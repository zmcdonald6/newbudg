# Musson Group IT's Budget Tracking Application

A cool tool that provides budget variance analysis to offer insights on the status of the department's budget through a streamlit web application.

## Overview
* The application works by first accepting a budget file and excel file in **Excel(.xlxs) format**.

* Once uploaded to the applicaiton it is stored securely using **Google Drive's API.**

* The application then has a section where you can generate a report using the inputted files. Once generated, the application presents various reports as well as a status dashboard allowing the user to attach categories to budget items.(To be confirmed, Wishlist, etc)


## Built With
* Backend Logic - Python 3.13

* Frontend - Python 3.13 (Streamlit API)

* Database - MySQL and Google Drive (File Storage)


## Setup
### Prerequisites
* Install python 3.13 through the official python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/

* Download MySQL through the official website at https://www.mysql.com/downloads/

* Setup a google cloud service account as this is what will be used to access the files in the drive.


#### Python Environment Setup
* Create your virtual environment; to do so you can navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the command "python -m venv venv". This creates a python virtual environment with the name "venv" in your home directory.

* To activate run "venv\Scripts\activate.bat". Once your environment is activated you should see the environment name beside your current directory. (e.g. (.venv) C:\Offline Files\Development\budgetapp\newbudg>)

* In the main directory there should be a file named "requirements.txt" that holds all python dependencies relevant to the application. Navigate to the directory and run "pip install -r requirements.txt"


#### Database setup
* Launch your mysql server, whether using a gui tool or in your terminal.
1) Create your database using the following mysql command - CREATE DATABASE my_project_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

2) Create a dedicated user CREATE USER 'my_project_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password';

3) Grant necessary permissions for the user - GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON my_project_db.* TO 'my_project_user'@'localhost';

4) Apply changes - FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

5) You should have been sent a data dump,


#### Google Account Setup
* To access your files through the API you will need to set up a google cloud service account. This can be setup through the google cloud website.


#### Configuration Setup
* Within the main directory there is a .streamlit folder that has a file "secretsexample.toml", this file contains database information(user, password, database name etc.) and google drive information. It will have a set of example values, you should remove this and input the values relevant to your program as the application reads from this file.
